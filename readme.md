# Skincare Ingredient Scout

An AI-powered web application that helps users identify potential conflicts and interactions between skincare ingredients, ensuring safer and more effective skincare routines.

## 🎯 About This Project

Skincare Ingredient Scout was created by a team of students who experienced skin problems from mixing incompatible skincare products. Many teenagers and skincare enthusiasts face similar issues - using products together that cause irritation, redness, or allergic reactions. This project aims to be a helpful tool that reminds people, especially teenagers, which products can and cannot be used together.

## ✨ Features

- **Ingredient Conflict Detection** - Analyze skincare ingredients to identify potential conflicts
- **Risk Assessment** - Get detailed risk scores (0-100) for ingredient combinations
- **Safety Recommendations** - Receive personalized suggestions for safer product usage
- **Beautiful Modern UI** - Pink-themed, card-based design with glassmorphism effects
- **Fully Responsive** - Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Ready to Use** - No installation required, just open and use

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Enter your skincare ingredients (separated by commas, semicolons, or new lines)
3. Click "Analyze" to get instant results
4. Review the analysis to see if your ingredient combination is safe or has potential conflicts

The application works completely offline and uses intelligent analysis to detect common ingredient conflicts like:
- Retinol + Acids (AHA/BHA)
- Vitamin C + Niacinamide
- Multiple active ingredients that may cause irritation

## 🛠️ Technology

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python Flask (optional, for future GNN model integration)
- **Future**: PyTorch, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for advanced ingredient analysis

## 📝 Project Mission

We are passionate about making skincare safer and more accessible. Our goal is to help people, especially teenagers, make smarter and safer choices when selecting and combining skincare products. By providing an easy-to-use tool that analyzes ingredient interactions, we hope to prevent skin problems and promote better skincare practices.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Integration of Graph Neural Network (GNN) models for more accurate conflict detection
- Photo detection with OCR to analyze product labels
- Expanded ingredient database with more detailed information
- User accounts and analysis history
